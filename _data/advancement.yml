- name: Increase attribute scores
  description: >
    You permanently increase an attribute score by 1 point.
    The AP cost is equal to the new score multiplied by 3.
    When a attribute score is raised, the derived values (Hit Points, Damage Bonus, unarmored Defense Points, etc.)
    will be affected as well. The max scores of your skills may increase as well, but the skill scores themselves
    remain unchanged.
  remark: |
    * Increasing an attribute from 5 to 6 would cost 6Â·3=18 APs.
    * Increasing an attribute from 20 to 23 would cost 63+66+69=198 APs.

- name: Increase skill scores
  description: >
    You permanently increase a skill score by 1 point.

  remark: |
    * Increasing a skill from 0 to 1 would cost 1 AP.
    * Increasing a skill from 15 to 16 would cost 16 APs.
    * Increasing a skill from 20 to 25 would cost 21+22+23+24+25=115 APs.
