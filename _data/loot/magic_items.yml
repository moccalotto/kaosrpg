- name: Little Big Tower
  description: |-
      Tiny figurine of a tower, similar to in size and design of a chess-piece rook.

      The owner can place it on the ground and speak a special word of command.
      When this is done, the figurine expands into a real tower,
      complete with furniture, cozy accommodations, and a number of
      minor servants (as per the spell *Servant, Minor*).

      When not inside the tower, the owner can speak the command word, and the tower
      collapses into its tiny form again.

      Once inside, guests can rearrange furniture in the tower as they like and the changes
      will remain in effect, even though the tower is dismissed.

      The guests can also store equipment, etc. in the tower without losing it. 
      It is worth noting that such items would be lost if the Little Big Tower was ever lost.

      Any persons inside the tower when it is collapsed would still be in there, and would experience
      normal time.

      There are several classes of Little Big Towers.

      | Class | Stories | Bedrooms | Servants |
      |:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
      |   1   |    2    |    3     |    1     |
      |   2   |    2    |    4     |    1     |
      |   3   |    3    |    5     |    2     |
      |   4   |    3    |    6     |    2     |
      |   5   |    4    |    7     |    3     |
      |   6   |    4    |    8     |    3     |

      **Variants**: 
      * Some towers cannot be collapsed while guests are inside.
      * Some towers "reset" when collapsed; anyone and anything inside is destroyed when
        the tower is collapsed. Furniture is moved back to their original position, etc.
      * Some towers can create feasts for the guests.
