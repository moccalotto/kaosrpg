This is an item that can magically transport hold equipment and goods
in another dimension.
The storage capacity of these items vary a lot, but an average storage item
can hold up to 10 cubic meters (or 10,000 kg) of goods,
Equipment and goods are normally stored and retrieved via magical teleportation.

A storage item can have any shape or size, for instance:
a wand,
a wallet,
a sack,
a scroll that holds pictures/drawings of all items stored,
or a crystal that glows brighter and brighter the more equipment it stores.


**Variants**:
* Some storage items are more similar to bags, sacks, wallets, pockets, chests, or backpacks;
    goods must be stored in them by physically placing them into the bag.
    These items usually have a limit on the size of the goods they can store.
* Some storage items have built-in stasis fields. This means that the stored goods are not subject to time.
* Some (cursed) storage items only allow inserting goods (i.e. goods cannot be retrieved once stored).
