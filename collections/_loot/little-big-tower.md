Tiny figurine of a tower, similar to in size and design of a chess-piece rook.

The owner can place it on the ground and speak a special word of command.
When this is done, the figurine expands into a real tower,
complete with furniture, cozy accommodations, and a number of
minor servants (as per the spell *Servant, Minor*).

The servants can do domestic chores such as cleaning, cooking, mending, etc.
Some towers also sport ghostly servants that can play musical instruments.

When not inside the tower, the owner can speak the command word, and the tower
collapses into its tiny form again.

Once inside, guests can rearrange furniture in the tower as they like and the changes
will remain in effect, even though the tower is dismissed.

The guests can also store equipment, etc. in the tower without losing it. 
It is worth noting that such items would be lost if the Little Big Tower was ever lost.

Any persons inside the tower when it is collapsed would still be in there, and would experience
normal time.

There are several types of Little Big Towers. They can anywhere from 2 to 10 (or more) stories,
2 to 20 (or more) bedrooms and 1 to 20 servants.

Below are some examples of Little Big Towers

| Stories | Bedrooms | Servants |
|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|    2    |   2-4    |    1     |
|    3    |   4-7    |    2     |
|    4    |   7-10   |    3     |
|    5    |  10-14   |   4-5    |

**Variants**: 
* Some towers cannot be collapsed while guests are inside.
* Some towers "reset" when collapsed; anyone and anything inside is destroyed when
  the tower is collapsed. Furniture is moved back to their original position, etc.
* Some towers can create feasts for the guests.
