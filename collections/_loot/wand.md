Magical wands are designed to improve a mages' magical potential; 
they store magical energy in the form of HP.
This means that the wielder can choose to let the wand
absorb some or all of the strain of casting spells.

A typical wand stores 20 HP worth of magical energy,
and turns to ash when it has lost all its HP,

Wands can *only* soak the strain of spellcasting,
and cannot absorb damage in any other way.

> **Example**: 
> You cast a spell that deals 6 points of strain and you
> use a wand that has 4 HP remaining.
> You could let the wand absorb 4 HP and soak up the last 2 HP yourself,
> or you could soak them all and save the wand for later.
> You could also split the damage 50/50 so that
> both you and the wand loose 3 HP, leaving the wand with 1 HP remaining.

**Variant**:
Some wands can be recharged via the *Recharge* spell.
Casting *Recharge* brings back 1+B points of HP per casting.
The wand can never be recharged to more than its maximum.

**Variant**:
Some wands are not destroyed when fully discharged;
they can be recharged back to full capacity at any point.
